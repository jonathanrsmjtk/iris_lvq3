# iris_lvq3
Hello, this is a classification of Iris datasets using Learning Vector Quantization 3 (LVQ 3) and its comparison with K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) and Random Forest Classifier.

Iris datasets contains three flower species with features (columns) such as 
1. Id
2. SepalLengthCm
3. SepalWidthCm
4. PetalLengthCm
5. PetalWidthCm
6. Species

# Comparison
Comparing with two other methods in K-Fold cross validation, you can see accuracy of LVQ 3 in plot below:

or these are results mean of:
- K-NN: 99,3%
- LVQ 3: 97,3%
- RFC:  98,67%

sure, it depends on parameter you used for three methods above.
